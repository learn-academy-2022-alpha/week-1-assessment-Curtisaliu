# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer:
Git is a software, while Github is a online platform that uses git software/technology.

  Researched answer:
Git is a version control system software that allows for both the management and tracking of ongoing programming projects.
Github is a cloud-based file hosting service, which uses Git. Github allows for better tracking and management if the project is open-sourced.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:
Equality, Relational, and Logical Operators will all return a Boolean value.

  Researched answer:
A boolean value is represented as True or False. The three stated above which are Equality, Relational and logical Operators will all return a value of either True or False, thus making them a boolean.


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:
An index is the location of where the element is which starts at the number 0.
The value is the variable within the element.
The difference between the two is that the index is considered the place holder/location of the variable. While the value is the actual variable itself.

  Researched answer:
An index is used as a reference to the actual place holder in the element's value of an array.
A value is used to define what the actual variable type value is being held in the elements/indexes.
The difference between the two is that the index tracks the placement of the element, while the value is defines what the variable is.

4. What is iteration?

  Your answer:
A computational process that will repeat itself.

  Researched answer:
Iteration is a process where a set of computational procedures is repeated by a specified number of times or until a condition is met.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:
Pair programming is when two individuals program together. One individual is the "driver" in which that person will be actively coding and sharing their screen. While the other individual is the "navigator" in which they guide the driver through the process of actively coding. The navigator also has roles such as trying to spot errors in which the driver may have made.

  Researched answer:
Pair programming is a technique that consists of two people collaborating on one code source to collectively produce one program. Supposedly the technique develops higher equality of code, while also being faster.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:
Higher order functions are functions that accept/or returns another function. The reason it is called higher-order is because it operates on functions.

2. Jest:
Jest is a test runner for javascript. It is a Javascript library for which people can create, run and structure tests. In short it is a testing framework in Javascript.

3. Objects:
Objects are stand-alone variables that act as containers that hold many values.

4. Method:
A method is a property of an object that contains a functions definition. A method consists of code that can be called upon by the name of the object. It is tied together to an object property, which is contrary to a function which can stand-alone.

5. Classes:
Templates/blueprint for creating objects which encapsulate data and functions that manipulate data. They can be called special functions that as two components class expressions and class declarations.
